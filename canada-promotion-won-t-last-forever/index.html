          <h1>Canada Promotion Won't Last Forever</h1>
          <p></p>
          <h3>Let’s explore the world: Recent Canadian promotion on Geoguessr</h3>
          <p></p>
          <p>How much do you know about the world you live in —the landmarks, the roads or the various fields? Any guesses? Here is an interesting website that will make you learn the places around the world. Play the game for as long as you can and you will be left guessing and questioning your memory and IQ.</p>
<p>Google Street View is a modern marvel that lets you drive through unknown cities or lonely streets in the middle of nowhere. GeoGuessr makes a game out of this desktop tourism: it takes you anywhere in the world and prompts you to find out where you are.</p>
<p>This initially seems impossible, because how the heck are you supposed to discern one tree-lined road from another? Is this Canada, or is it France?</p>
<p>However, it feels more like Canada. You can't say why. Somewhere in the back of your mind, all the TV shows and movies you've ever seen tell you that the texture of the trees and grass feels more Canadian than French.</p>
<p>Or you may notice a traffic sign, a license plate, the style of a distant building. You zoom into the map and choose a point, a rough guess, and find that you have hit it within a few hundred kilometers. It was luck, but it was also a kind of subconscious withdrawal. You go again This time you ended up in a city and have a lot more to offer. It will be easy!</p>
<p>You get it wrong, about four thousand miles. You can certainly do better. You go again</p>
<p>And again and again and again until your day is gone. GeoGuessr takes a modern wonder and turns it into a game. It is a miracle itself.</p>
<p>Teachers can use Geoguessr as an extension in geographic or cultural classrooms, or as an exercise in media literacy and critical thinking in any content area. It can serve as a stimulus for teaching and learning both online and print-based research skills and techniques, or as an inspiration for student-designed games that use free online resources such as photo collections. With engaging play and more in-depth discussions in small groups or across the class, geoguessr teachers can build background knowledge of geography and places that are new to students (or even teachers). Teachers can also connect to classrooms in their schools or around the world to share challenges and build relationships between students.</p>
<p>If your school has a Pro account, encourage students to create their own map challenges once they are familiar with how Geoguessr works. Have them create cards that have a personal meaning or are based on a topic you learn in class. Groups or individuals who buy the same card can compete against each other. If there is no room for a subscription in the budget, your classroom can still play a different card every day along with the daily challenge and play the free world at will.</p>
<p>Give students in difficulty tips such as: Pay attention to the side of the street, the color of the stripes, the manufacturer of the map (Google Maps versus Mapillary), the tree species, the sky and the surrounding landforms, people and clothing and of course all signs or symbols they see.</p>
<p>Conclusion: It's not a typical educational game, but Geoguessr inspires students to explore the world and encourages them to think critically about what makes a place, including culture and geography.</p>
